# Lightbulb On/Off Project

## Overview

This project is a simple web-based interactive lightbulb that can be toggled on or off with a switch. The project demonstrates basic HTML, CSS, and JavaScript functionality to simulate a light switch turning a lightbulb on and off.

## Files

- **index.html**: The main HTML file that defines the structure of the lightbulb and the switch.
- **style.css**: The CSS file that styles the lightbulb, switch, and the entire page layout.
- **script.js**: The JavaScript file that controls the behavior of the switch and toggles the lightbulb on and off.

## Functionality

- A switch on the right side of the screen can be clicked to toggle the lightbulb on or off.
- When the lightbulb is on, it changes color to a bright yellow, simulating a glowing effect.
- The switch changes its visual state to reflect whether the light is on or off.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML**: To define the structure of the webpage and the lightbulb elements.
- **CSS**: To style the switch and the lightbulb, including visual effects such as glowing and shadows.
- **JavaScript**: To handle the interaction, detecting clicks on the switch and updating the appearance of the lightbulb and switch.
